MBC1 (Memory Bank Controller 1) is one of the simplest and most common cartridge memory bank controllers used in Game Boy games. It’s a piece of hardware on the cartridge that extends the Game Boy’s limited memory capabilities, allowing games to access larger ROM and RAM sizes than the base system supports. Let’s break it down clearly.

### What is MBC1?
The Game Boy’s CPU can address 64KB of memory (0x0000–0xFFFF), but only 32KB (0x0000–0x7FFF) is reserved for cartridge ROM, and there’s no built-in RAM beyond the internal 8KB WRAM (0xC000–0xDFFF). MBC1 is a chip on the cartridge that manages bank switching to access up to **2MB of ROM** and **32KB of RAM**, far exceeding the base system’s limits.

- **Purpose**: Enables larger games by swapping different "banks" of ROM and RAM into the Game Boy’s address space.
- **Introduced**: Used in early Game Boy titles (e.g., *Super Mario Land*, *The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening*).
- **Variants**: Supports two modes—ROM Banking Mode and RAM Banking Mode—to prioritize either more ROM or RAM access.

### Memory Regions Affected by MBC1
MBC1 controls two main regions in the Game Boy’s memory map:
1. **ROM (0x0000–0x7FFF)**:
   - **0x0000–0x3FFF**: Fixed Bank (Bank 0 of ROM, always accessible).
   - **0x4000–0x7FFF**: Switchable Bank (Banks 1–127, swapped via MBC1 registers).
   - **Max Size**: 2MB (128 banks of 16KB each).

2. **External RAM (0xA000–0xBFFF)**:
   - Switchable RAM banks (0–3), each 8KB.
   - **Max Size**: 32KB (4 banks of 8KB each), though smaller sizes like 8KB (1 bank) are common.

### How MBC1 Works
MBC1 uses a set of registers mapped to the ROM address space (0x0000–0x7FFF). Writing specific values to these addresses tells the MBC1 chip which ROM or RAM bank to make active. These writes don’t alter the ROM itself (it’s read-only); they configure the MBC1’s internal state.

#### MBC1 Registers
These are memory-mapped registers accessed by writing to specific address ranges:
1. **RAM Enable (0x0000–0x1FFF)**:
   - **Purpose**: Enables or disables access to External RAM.
   - **Value**: Write 0x0A to enable RAM; any other value disables it.
   - **Behavior**: When disabled, reads from 0xA000–0xBFFF return garbage, and writes are ignored.

2. **ROM Bank Number (0x2000–0x3FFF)**:
   - **Purpose**: Selects the ROM bank for 0x4000–0x7FFF.
   - **Value**: 5-bit value (0x01–0x1F, 1–31). Writing 0x00 is treated as 0x01.
   - **Behavior**: Sets the lower 5 bits of the ROM bank number. Higher bits come from the Banking Mode register (see below).

3. **RAM Bank Number / Upper ROM Bank Bits (0x4000–0x5FFF)**:
   - **Purpose**: Dual-use register, depending on mode:
     - **ROM Banking Mode**: Sets upper 2 bits of ROM bank number (extends range to 128 banks).
     - **RAM Banking Mode**: Selects RAM bank (0–3).
   - **Value**: 2-bit value (0x00–0x03).

4. **Banking Mode Select (0x6000–0x7FFF)**:
   - **Purpose**: Switches between ROM Banking Mode and RAM Banking Mode.
   - **Value**: 
     - 0x00: ROM Banking Mode (default).
     - 0x01: RAM Banking Mode.
   - **Behavior**: Affects how the 0x4000–0x5FFF register is interpreted.

#### Banking Modes
MBC1 has two modes to balance ROM and RAM capacity:
- **ROM Banking Mode (Default)**:
  - **ROM**: Up to 2MB (128 banks). The 5-bit ROM Bank Number (0x2000–0x3FFF) and 2-bit upper bits (0x4000–0x5FFF) form a 7-bit bank number (0x00–0x7F, though 0x00 maps to 0x01).
  - **RAM**: Limited to 8KB (Bank 0 only; 0xA000–0xBFFF).
  - **Use Case**: Games with large ROM (e.g., 512KB or 1MB) and minimal RAM needs.

- **RAM Banking Mode**:
  - **ROM**: Limited to 512KB (32 banks). The upper 2 bits (0x4000–0x5FFF) are ignored for ROM banking.
  - **RAM**: Up to 32KB (4 banks, selected by 0x4000–0x5FFF).
  - **Use Case**: Games needing more RAM (e.g., save data) but less ROM.

### Bank Switching Details
- **ROM Bank Switching**:
  - Bank 0 is always at 0x0000–0x3FFF.
  - Banks 1–127 (depending on cartridge size) swap into 0x4000–0x7FFF.
  - Special Case: Writing bank numbers 0x00, 0x20, 0x40, or 0x60 to 0x2000–0x3FFF in ROM Banking Mode maps to 0x01, 0x21, 0x41, or 0x61 (to avoid overlap with Bank 0).

- **RAM Bank Switching**:
  - Only active in RAM Banking Mode.
  - Banks 0–3 map to 0xA000–0xBFFF.
  - If RAM is smaller than 32KB (e.g., 8KB), only Bank 0 is used, and higher bank numbers may be ignored.

### Example
Imagine a game with 1MB ROM (64 banks) and 32KB RAM (4 banks):
1. **Enable RAM**: Write 0x0A to 0x1000.
2. **Select ROM Bank 5**: Write 0x05 to 0x2000 (0x4000–0x7FFF now shows Bank 5).
3. **Switch to RAM Banking Mode**: Write 0x01 to 0x6000.
4. **Select RAM Bank 2**: Write 0x02 to 0x4000 (0xA000–0xBFFF now accesses RAM Bank 2).
5. **Write Data**: Store data at 0xA100; it goes to RAM Bank 2.

Later, switch back to ROM Banking Mode (0x00 to 0x6000) and set upper ROM bits (e.g., 0x01 to 0x4000) with lower bits (0x05 to 0x2000) for Bank 37 (0x25 in hex).

### Interaction with 16-bit Instructions
From your earlier question about 16-bit instructions:
- **`LD (nn), SP`** can write to MBC1 registers (e.g., 0x2000) if `nn` targets them, but it’s a 16-bit write across two addresses (e.g., 0x2000 and 0x2001). Only the low byte (at 0x2000) affects the MBC1; the high byte (0x2001) might be ignored or interpreted separately.
- **Stack Operations** (`PUSH`, `CALL`): If `SP` points to ROM (0x0000–0x7FFF), writes are ignored by ROM but could trigger MBC1 register changes if they hit the right ranges.

### Quirks and Limitations
- **Bank 0 Overlap**: In ROM Banking Mode, selecting certain banks (0x00, 0x20, etc.) adjusts to avoid masking Bank 0 at 0x0000–0x3FFF.
- **Smaller Cartridges**: If ROM is ≤512KB or RAM is 8KB, some register bits are unused, and behavior simplifies.
- **No Fine Control**: MBC1 lacks advanced features like timers or rumble (unlike MBC3 or MBC5).

### Summary
- **MBC1**: A basic bank controller for up to 2MB ROM and 32KB RAM.
- **Regions**: ROM (0x0000–0x7FFF), RAM (0xA000–0xBFFF).
- **Registers**: Control bank switching via writes to 0x0000–0x7FFF.
- **Modes**: ROM Banking (big ROM, small RAM) vs. RAM Banking (small ROM, big RAM).
